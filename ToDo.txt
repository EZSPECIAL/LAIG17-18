TP2:

Animations:
	- Linear animation (testing)
	- Circular animation (testing)
	- Bezier animation (testing - is orientation correct?)
	- Combo animation (just use MyAnimationRef?)
	- Rename MyAnimationRef as MyAnimationHandler?
	- Linear -> Circular -> Linear
	- 2x Bezier + 1+ Linear or Circular (Creeper around the house?)

Shaders:
	- Fragment shader (Selection color)
	- Vertex shader (Expand to normals)
	- setUniformValues ranges from [-1, 1] or [0, 1] using trig function
	- Apply shader to selectable (must have at least 3 selectable nodes)

Misc:
	- Remove //TODO before delivery
	- Comment everything

ASK
	- Animations don't warp to initial position since they are affected by transformations as explained in handout (0, 0, 0) is the object's position and not the origin
	- Selection color (option in code / option in GUI?)
	- Selection shader (GUI option?)
